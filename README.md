## Learning Outcomes

### Official Course Description

> An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce artifacts such as interactive games and computer-mediated art and music. Students also learn how to organize and document a programâ€™s source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Bring moderately complex ideas to life through a digital medium
- Interact with a computer through a terminal window
- Express basic fluency in the Python programming language
- Understand the principles of object-oriented programming
- Independently utilize industry-standard tools, such as Git, GitHub, Jupyter notebooks, and Markdown
- Create documentation to effectively communicate a program's intended behavior, as well as its potential issues, with its users and maintainers
