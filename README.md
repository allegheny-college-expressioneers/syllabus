## Learning Outcomes

### Official Course Description

> An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce artifacts such as interactive games and computer-mediated art and music. Students also learn how to organize and document a programâ€™s source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Bring moderately complex ideas to life through a digital medium
- Interact with a computer through a terminal window
- Express basic fluency in the Python programming language
- Understand the principles of object-oriented programming
- Independently utilize industry-standard tools, such as search engines, Git, GitHub, and Markdown
- Create documentation to effectively communicate a program's intended behavior, as well as its potential issues, with its users and maintainers

#### Attendance

This course will move fast! We have a lot of exciting material to cover. It will be much easier for you to make sure you are keeping pace if you are present for every class and laboratory session. Not only does it give you the opportunity to check your understanding, ask questions, and get feedback on your assignments, but it is invaluable time to get to know your peers, who may someday become part of your professional network or even lifelong friends!

During the Fall 2021 <!-- UPDATEME --> semester, between classes and lab sessions, we will meet a total of 58 times. I will note your attendance each time and at the end of the semester your attendance will be converted from a fraction (**# of classes and lab sessions attended / 58**) to a percentage (all percentages will be rounded up to the nearest whole percentage). You will then earn this number of points towards your attendance grade.

If you ever find yourself sick or in need of a mental health day, please stay home and rest. **You can still receive your attendance for the class or lab session you missed as long as you communicate with me your reason for missing the class or lab session by the end of that day**. If there are extenuating circumstances that make you unable to communicate with me through Discord or email by the end of the day of your absence, make sure to follow up with me at your earliest ability. If you do not communicate the reason for your absence before or during the next time I see you, I will assume that your absence was avoidable and you will not receive attendance for that class or lab session.

#### Weekly Work: Exercises and Laboratory Assignments

Every Friday, you will receive a set of readings on the topics that we will be covering in the following week. The readings will contain exercises for you to complete outside of class. These exercises might ask you to run a command in a terminal window and record its output, answer a question, or write some code. I expect you to make an honest attempt at every exercise, *especially* when they are challenging. It is okay to get things wrong, as long as you have earnestly tried! Exercises will be graded based on efforts at completion, rather than correctness.

Along with the set of readings and their accompanying exercises, you will also receive a laboratory assignment each week. These lab assignments will ask you to engage with code in many different ways such as debugging, writing, or documenting. They are designed to make you put into practice the topics that we are covering that week as a demonstration of your understanding. Lab assignments will be graded based on both completion and correctness.

The instructions for each lab assignment will always specify whether you are to complete the lab assignment individually or with other students in a group. For group lab assignments, you are expected to divide the work equally among group members. Group lab assignments will always include a follow-up survey that each member will fill out individually about the contributions of their group members. Each group member may receive a different grade depending on the feedback from this survey.

For all lab assignments, please feel free to use online resources, such as Python documentation and StackOverflow, with common sense. For instance, you are welcome to (and should!) look at existing StackOverflow questions that relate to your search query, but please do not ask on StackOverflow for someone to solve a lab assignment for you.

Both exercises and laboratory assignments will be due by 11:59 PM on the Sunday of the week after they are released.

#### Quizzes

As you may have noticed, there will be a much greater emphasis on "doing"--on analyzing, writing, and documenting code--than on memorizing and recalling information in this course, just as there is within the field of computer science.

Because of this, quizzes only constitute a small portion of your grade and I will drop your lowest score. Rather than evaluating your ability to memorize and recall information, quizzes are meant more to help you to self-assess your progress and me to determine what topics require more time and attention.

Quizzes will be due by 11:59 PM each Thursday. This is to give me enough time to review responses so that I know what to review during the Friday class.

#### Final Project

The final project, the specifics of which will be announced later in the semester, is an opportunity for you to use all of the skills and knowledge that you have accumulated throughout the course to create a **really cool** program.

You will have approximately one month to work on your final project. During this time, you will write a proposal, create an implementation plan, work on code, provide progress updates, and, at the end of the semester, present and demonstrate your program to your peers. All of this will count towards your final project grade.

#### Due Dates

Each exercise, laboratory assignment, quiz, and the final project will clearly state its due date in its instructions.

##### Late Work Policy

For weekly work (i.e. exercises and lab assignments), you will lose 5% from the exercises and/or 5% from the lab assignment for each day the work is late after the due date, up until a week after the due date. If the work is not submitted by 11:59 PM the Sunday after its original due date, you will receive no points for the exercises and/or lab assignment.

For quizzes, you will automatically receive zero points for quizzes that are not received by their due dates.

##### Extensions

You will have three two-day extensions to use for weekly work. When you use an extension, the exercises and lab assignment for that week will be due at 11:59 PM on Tuesday, rather than Sunday. To use an extension, please communicate with me in writing, either through Discord or email, **before the due date** that you would like to use an extension. **If you do not communicate with me that you are using an extension, and continue to submit additional work after the due date, I will consider the work late and grade according to the late work policy outlined above.**

Additionally, you will have two extensions to use for quizzes. When you use an extension, the quiz will be due anytime before the start of Friday's class, which is 10:20 AM <!-- UPDATEME -->, rather than at 11:59 PM on Thursday. If the quiz is not received before Friday's class, the late work policy holds and you will receive zero points for that quiz.

You are free to use your extensions at your own discretion, but please do try to save them for truly rainy days.

If you use all three of your extensions and find yourself in need of an additional extension due to extenuating circumstances, please reach out to me to discuss your situation. It is never my intention for this course to be stress- or anxiety-producing; due dates are in place not to create pressure, but to make sure that we are able to visit all of the topics that we need to cover.
