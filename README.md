# Welcome to CMPSC 100: Computational Expression at Allegheny College, Fall 2021 <!-- UPDATEME-->

Up to this point, you might have used your computer to write Google Docs, watch YouTube videos, or listen to your favorite music on Spotify. Believe it or not, you can use the very same computer to create the next Minecraft, design a new social media platform, or even develop software to help cure diseases! You have everything you need to change the world right at your fingertips. Ready to learn how? This course will teach you how to bring your digital dreams to life using computational thinking.

## Learning Outcomes

### Official Course Description

> An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce artifacts such as interactive games and computer-mediated art and music. Students also learn how to organize and document a programâ€™s source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Bring moderately complex ideas to life through a digital medium
- Interact with a computer through a terminal window
- Express basic fluency in the Python programming language
- Understand the principles of object-oriented programming
- Independently utilize industry-standard tools, such as search engines, Git, GitHub, and Markdown
- Create documentation to effectively communicate a program's intended behavior, as well as its potential issues, with its users and maintainers
