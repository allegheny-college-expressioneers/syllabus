## Learning Outcomes

### Official Course Description

> An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce artifacts such as interactive games and computer-mediated art and music. Students also learn how to organize and document a program’s source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Bring moderately complex ideas to life through a digital medium
- Interact with a computer through a terminal window
- Express basic fluency in the Python programming language
- Understand the principles of object-oriented programming
- Independently utilize industry-standard tools, such as search engines, Git, GitHub, and Markdown
- Create documentation to effectively communicate a program's intended behavior, as well as its potential issues, with its users and maintainers

## Grading

### Breakdown

| Category                        | Percentage |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Attendance                      | 10%        |
| Reading Comprehension Exercises | 20%        |
| Laboratory Assignments          | 40%        |

| **Total**                       | **100%**   |

#### Attendance

This course will move fast! We have a lot of exciting material to cover. It will be much easier for you to keep pace if you attend every class and laboratory session. Not only does being present give you the opportunity to check your understanding, ask questions, and get feedback on your assignments, but it gives you valuable time to get to know your peers, who may someday become part of your professional network or even lifelong friends!

I will note your attendance each class or lab session and at the end of the semester your attendance will be converted from a fraction (**# of classes and lab sessions attended / total # of classes and lab sessions**) to a percentage (all percentages will be rounded up to the nearest whole percentage). This attendance grade will make up 10% of your overall grade.

If you ever find yourself sick or in need of a mental health day, please stay home and rest. **You can still receive your attendance for the class or lab session you missed as long as you communicate with me your reason for missing the class or lab session by the end of that day**. If there are extenuating circumstances that make you unable to communicate with me through Discord or email by the end of the day of your absence, make sure to follow up with me at your earliest ability. If you do not communicate the reason for your absence before or during the next time I see you, I will assume that your absence was avoidable and you will not receive attendance for that class or lab session.

#### Reading Comprehension Exercises

Every Friday, you will receive a set of readings on the topics that we will be covering in the following week as well as a suggested reading schedule. The readings contain exercises that will help you check your comprehension as you progress through them. These exercises might ask you to run a command in a terminal window and record its output, answer a question, or write some code. I expect you to make an honest attempt at every exercise, *especially* when they are challenging. It is perfectly acceptable to get things wrong as long as you have earnestly tried! Exercises will be graded based on efforts at completion, rather than correctness.

Reading comprehension exercises will be due the next Thursday after they are released.

#### Laboratory Assignments

Every Wednesday, you will receive a laboratory assignment. These lab assignments will ask you to engage with code in various ways such as debugging, writing, or documenting. In addition to requiring you to apply the skills and knowledge that you have accumulated in prior weeks, lab assignments will challenge you to put into practice the current week's topics as a demonstration of your understanding. Lab assignments will be graded based on completion, correctness, and quality. What exactly is meant by completion, correctness, and quality will vary from lab assignment to lab assignment, but will always be clearly described in the instructions for each lab assignment.

The instructions for each lab assignment will also always specify whether you are to complete the lab assignment individually or with other students in a group. For group lab assignments, you are expected to divide the work equally among group members. Group lab assignments will always include a follow-up survey that each member will fill out individually about the contributions of their group members. Each group member may receive a different grade depending on the feedback from this survey.

Lab assignments will be due one week after they are released (i.e. before the next lab session on Wednesday).

#### Quizzes

As you may have noticed, there will be a much greater emphasis on "doing"--on analyzing, writing, and documenting code--than on memorizing and recalling information in this course, just as there is within the field of computer science.

Because of this, quizzes only constitute a small portion of your grade and I will drop your lowest score. Rather than evaluating your ability to memorize and recall information, quizzes are meant to help you self-assess your progress and to help me determine what topics require more time and attention.

Quizzes will be administered on Friday each week.

#### Final Project

The final project, the specifics of which will be announced later in the semester, is an opportunity for you to use all of the skills and knowledge that you have accumulated throughout the course to create a **really cool** program.

You will have approximately one month to work on your final project. During this time, you will write a proposal, create an implementation plan, work on code, provide progress updates, and, at the end of the semester, present and demonstrate your program to your peers. All of this will count towards your final project grade.

### Due Dates and Extensions

Unless otherwise announced by me, reading comprehension exercises, laboratory assignments, and the final project will be due on the date and at the time stated in their instructions.

Extensions for reading comprehension exercises, lab assignments, and select portions of the final project may be granted on a case-by-case basis at my discretion if there are extenuating circumstances that significantly affect your ability to complete the work on time. You must communicate with me before the due date, preferably at least one week in advance, that you would like to request an extension. **If you do not communicate with me about an extension before the due date, I reserve the right to grade only the work submitted by the due date, even if you submit additional work after the due date.**

### Scale

| Letter Grade | Percentage   |
|--------------|--------------|
| A            | 96 - 100     |
| A-           | 90 - 95      |
| B+           | 87 - 89      |
| B            | 83 - 86      |
| B-           | 80 - 82      |
| C+           | 77-79        |
| C            | 73 - 76      |
| C-           | 70 - 72      |
| D+           | 67 - 69      |
| D            | 63 - 66      |
| D-           | 60 - 62      |
| F            | 59 and below |

Fractional grades will be rounded to the nearest whole percentage, according to normal rounding rules. For example, 89.49 will become 89 and 89.5 will become 90.

## Institutional And Departmental Policies

### Statement of Community

Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

### Honor Code


The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and the final project). All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program. Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following pledge:

> I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.

It is understood that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly one in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work. While it is acceptable for students in this class to discuss their programs, data sets, and reports with their classmates, deliverables that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.


### Disability Services

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at (814) 332-2898.  ODS is located in Pelletier Library.  Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.
